## How it works

Blender's embedded Python cannot load PyTorch or Kimodo directly. The addon solves this with a two-process bridge:

```
Blender (addon)                Kimodo venv
  subprocess_client.py  ─────▶  bridge_server.py
                        ◀─────  (model loaded once, handles requests)
```

The bridge server loads the Kimodo model once at startup and then responds to generation requests over stdin/stdout. Blender stays responsive while generation runs in a background thread.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Blender 4.0+ | Tested on 5.1 (Windows & Arch Linux) |
| Python 3.10–3.12 | System Python used to create the managed venv |
| NVIDIA GPU | 8 GB+ VRAM recommended; 16 GB+ for best results |
| CUDA | Must match your PyTorch build (CUDA 12.1 installed by default) |
| ~10 GB disk | For the managed venv, model weights, and LLM2Vec encoder |

> **Low VRAM?** Run `kimodo_textencoder --device cpu` in a separate terminal with the Kimodo venv activated. This offloads the text encoder to CPU and frees several GB of VRAM.

---

## Installation

As of v1.2.0 Kimodo installs itself automatically — no terminal required. The addon is also compatible with the Blender 4.2+ Extensions platform (includes `blender_manifest.toml`).

### 1 — Install the Blender addon

1. Download or clone this repository (top-right **Code → Download ZIP**).
2. Open Blender → **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install from Disk…**
3. Select the downloaded zip and enable **"Kimodo Motion Generator"**.

### 2 — Click "Install Kimodo (Auto)"

Open the **Kimodo** N-Panel tab (press `N` in the 3D Viewport), expand **Connection**, and click **Install Kimodo (Auto)**.

The installer will:
- Create a managed Python venv at `~/.kimodo-venv/`
- Install PyTorch (CUDA 12.1), all Kimodo dependencies, and the [Aero-Ex offline fork](https://github.com/Aero-Ex/kimodo)
- Download the LLM2Vec text-encoder model locally and patch it for offline use
- Download the `Kimodo-SOMA-RP-v1` model weights into the HF cache
- Set the Python path automatically when done

Progress is shown live in the Connection panel. The full log is printed to the system console (launch Blender from a terminal, or on Windows use **Window → Toggle System Console**).

> **Requires:** Python 3.10–3.12 on your system PATH, internet access, and ~10 GB of free disk space. After the initial install, Kimodo runs fully offline.

### Manual installation (advanced)

If you already have Kimodo installed in your own venv, skip the auto-installer and paste the path to your venv Python into the **Kimodo Python** field in the Connection panel.

## Quick Start

### Generate motion from a text prompt

1. **Start** the bridge: click **Start Kimodo** in the Connection panel.  
   The status line will show *Loading model…* then *Ready* once the model is loaded (this takes 10–60 s the first time).

2. Open the **Generate** panel. It opens in **Single Clip** mode — type a prompt (e.g. `a person jogs in a circle`), set a duration, and click **Generate Motion**.

3. A `Kimodo_Source` armature will appear in your scene with the generated motion applied.

> **30 FPS tip:** Kimodo always generates at 30 FPS. If your scene is set to a different frame rate, an alert will appear above the Generate button with a **Set to 30 FPS** button.

### Use multiple segments

Switch the **Generate** panel to **Timeline** mode for this. Each segment is an independent text prompt mapped to a frame range. **Generate Motion** sends every enabled segment to Kimodo in a single model call, producing one continuous animation with smooth transitions between prompts.

- Segments are listed in order. The **Start** frame of each segment after the first is automatically locked to the **End** frame of the previous segment — just drag the End frame and the next segment's Start updates automatically.
- Use **Duplicate** to copy a segment and place it immediately after.
- Use **↑ / ↓** to reorder segments.

### Retarget to your own rig

After generating motion you can drive any armature from the Kimodo source:

1. Open the **Retarget** panel.
2. Set **Source** to `Kimodo_Source` and **Target** to your character rig.
3. Click **Auto-Match Bones** — the addon fuzzy-matches Kimodo bone names against your rig.
4. Review the mapping, enable/disable pairs, choose a retarget mode per bone. Its recommended to also adjust the scale of the armature to match your character and then applying it with CTRL+A.
5. Choose the type of constraint the plugin should use, "Child of", "Copy Rotation" etc...
6. Click **Apply Constraints** — Blender constraint drivers are added to your rig.
7. Click **Bake & Remove Constraints** when you are happy — keyframes are baked onto your rig and all Kimodo constraints are removed, leaving a clean, self-contained animation.

Use **Save / Load Preset** to store bone mappings for a rig and reuse them later.

### Motion constraints

Spatial goals can be given to Kimodo so the generated motion passes through specific positions:

| Constraint | What it controls |
|---|---|
| Root XZ | Where the character's root lands on the ground plane |
| Full-Body | A full joint-pose keyframe (pose a reference armature) |
| Left / Right Hand | Wrist end-effector position |
| Left / Right Foot | Foot / heel end-effector position |

To add a constraint:
1. Move the 3D cursor (or select an armature) to the desired position.
2. Set the timeline to the target frame.
3. In the **Motion Constraints** panel, click the constraint type.

**Auto-Origin** (off by default) shifts all constraint positions so the earliest root waypoint lands at Kimodo's world origin — author constraints anywhere in your scene without worrying about absolute coordinates.

**Auto Face Path** (on by default, fork feature) makes plain Root XZ waypoints "just work": Kimodo always starts a motion facing its canonical direction (−Y in Blender), so a path authored in any other direction either crab-walked (no headings) or spent ~1 s turning into place (with headings) — and a heading that contradicted the path made the motion degenerate. With Auto Face Path the addon rotates the waypoints so the direction of travel matches the model's native facing, centers the first waypoint on the model's (0,0) origin, and bakes the inverse transform back into the imported action's root bone. The character walks forward along your path from frame 1, the motion lands exactly on your world-space waypoints, and the armature object keeps an identity transform so retargeting is unaffected. The rotation parameters travel in a `.canonical.json` sidecar next to each generated BVH, so re-importing from history un-rotates correctly too. It applies whenever every enabled constraint is a Root XZ waypoint; mixed runs with fullbody/effector constraints are sent as-is. Turn it off to send raw coordinates (and manual headings — see below).

### Headings with Auto Face Path (advanced)

Leave every "Include Heading" unticked and the addon sends no heading constraints at all — thanks to the path rotation the character faces along the path on its own, which is the cleanest conditioning. Ticking "Include Heading" on a waypoint opts into heading steering:

- **Kimodo only accepts a heading for every waypoint or none** — a partial list is silently dropped. With Auto Face Path active the addon fills the gaps automatically: your value on the waypoints you ticked, the local path direction everywhere else (towards the next waypoint; the last waypoint reuses the previous segment). So one ticked heading means "face *this* way here, follow the path elsewhere".
- Angles are authored in **scene world coordinates**: 0° = −Y, 90° = +X, 180° = +Y, 270° = −X — the angle equals `atan2(dx, −dy)` of the facing vector (the pre-1.6 claim "0 = +Y forward" was wrong). The addon rotates your value along with the waypoints; you never deal with the model's internal frame.
- Facing **between** waypoints is not controlled — the model interpolates freely. Pin a turn with denser waypoints around it.
- **Avoid a manual heading on the first waypoint that differs from the path direction**: the model always starts facing its canonical direction, which Auto Face Path aligns with the first path segment — contradicting it reintroduces the warm-up turn, or worse. Corner headings on later waypoints are the intended use ("walk north, then face east here").
- A heading pointing across or against the direction of travel is deliberately extreme ("walk sideways", "walk backwards"): the model may nail it or degenerate — expect seed hunting.

### Model quirks worth knowing

- **The root wants to start near (0,0).** Kimodo is trained on origin-rooted data; sending a path offset by a few meters degrades the gait at the same seed — a swaying root path (up to ~0.8 m off the line) and duck-footed, "crab"-looking steps with the feet splayed ±40–55° while the torso faces forward. Auto Face Path centers the first waypoint on the model origin and translates the result back, so this is handled automatically — but if you ever send raw coordinates (Auto Face Path off, Auto-Origin off), keep waypoints near the world origin.
- **Sparse waypoints leave freedom**: with only two waypoints several meters apart the root path can bow ~0.5–1.4 m off the straight line. The waypoints themselves are always hit exactly; tighten the path with more waypoints or *Sample Curve as Waypoints*.
- **After the last waypoint the motion is unconstrained** — the character keeps walking. Put the final waypoint on the last frame of the clip, or trim the tail.
- When diagnosing a weird gait numerically, measure the **feet** (e.g. heel→toe direction), not the shoulders: the "crab" above had perfectly aligned shoulders and pelvis while only the feet were splayed.

## Troubleshooting

**Bridge won't start / "Failed to start"**
- Check the system console for `[Kimodo Bridge]` lines — the full Python/PyTorch error is printed there.
- Check that the Python path points to the venv Python that has Kimodo installed.
- If you used the auto-installer and it failed partway through, click **Retry Install** — it will wipe the partial venv and start clean.

**CUDA out of memory**
- Use a shorter duration or fewer segments.

**Retargeted rig is in the wrong pose**
- Try a different retarget mode per bone (Copy Rotation vs Copy Transforms vs Child Of).
- Make sure the source and target armatures are both in their rest pose / have the same pose before trying the retargeting, and have scale applied on the armature.

**Frames from imorted animation dont match**
- Kimodo generates at exactly 30 FPS. Use the **Set to 30 FPS** button that appears in the Generate panel when your scene is at a different frame rate.
